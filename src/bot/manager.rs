//! Lifecycle + decision-point batching for the active bot.
//!
//! `BotManager` owns one `Box<dyn BotRunner>`, subscribes to the
//! post-tracker bus, accumulates events between decision points, and
//! broadcasts every `BotResponse` (including `MjaiEvent::None`) onto a
//! `BotResponseBus` for downstream consumers (HUD, storage, external WS).
//!
//! A decision point is an event where the riichi engine says our seat
//! owes the game an answer. The event's shape narrows the candidates —
//! only some kinds of event can open a decision for us — and the engine's
//! `can_act`, computed by the tracker at the instant it applied that same
//! event, settles it.
//!
//! Asking the engine matters because a bot cannot tell us. It is fed every
//! event and answers every event, so an mjai `none` reads identically for
//! "I weighed this call and decline it" and "this was never mine to
//! answer" — and a consumer that acts on replies (autoplay) has to know
//! which. Not asking also spends a full inference round-trip, and on the
//! cloud path a paid API call, on events with no decision in them.
//!
//! ## Status & notification emission
//!
//! Every lifecycle transition is published to two side-channel buses for
//! the IPC layer:
//!
//! - `BotStatusBus` — typed state machine
//!   (`Idle/Loading/Ready/Error/Stopped`). The frontend renders a spinner
//!   on `Loading{SyncingDeps}` so the user knows the slow first-run
//!   `uv sync` is in progress, not a hang.
//! - `NotifyBus` — toast-style notifications. Loading and error events
//!   reuse the same `id` (`"bot-loading-<name>"`) so the sticky
//!   "preparing" toast is replaced rather than duplicated when the spawn
//!   resolves.
