//! Did the click actually land?
//!
//! A synthetic click can be swallowed — the UI was still animating, the
//! button had not finished popping in, the engine sampled the cursor a
//! frame too early. The press itself reports success either way: the page
//! dispatched the events, and nothing downstream says whether the client
//! did anything with them.
//!
//! The client's own uplink is the answer. Accepting a discard, a call or a
//! win makes it send `.lq.FastTest.inputOperation` /
//! `.lq.FastTest.inputChiPengGang` — so a click followed by one of those is
//! a click that registered, and a click followed by silence is one to try
//! again. The bridge counts them here as it parses; the autoplay manager
//! takes a ticket before pressing and asks afterwards whether the count
//! moved.
//!
//! A counter rather than a timestamp: the question is "did *another* one
//! happen since my ticket", which a monotonic count answers without any
//! clock comparison, and which cannot be confused by two inputs landing in
//! the same millisecond.
