//! Tenhou autoplay: drive the client's own input path.
//!
//! Writing frames onto the socket behind the client's back does not work: its
//! receive path deliberately ignores the server's echo of *our* discard
//! (`1==U.a && "D"==c.tag || Nb.cb(c)`) because its own handler already
//! applied it locally. Bypass that handler and the board freezes from the
//! first discard on, while the server plays the hand out without it.
//!
//! So actions are performed the way the user performs them:
//!
//! - **Buttons** — chi, pon, kan, riichi, ron, tsumo, kyuushu, kita and pass
//!   are DOM elements the client routes through a body-level click listener
//!   keyed on `name="c22-<slot>"`. A dispatched click runs the client's own
//!   handler, so nothing can drift. No coordinates involved.
//! - **Discard** — no DOM element exists for it, but it needs no position
//!   either: the client's own discard handler takes a tile *index*, and
//!   [`inject`] rewrites the client script in flight so that handler is
//!   reachable.
//!
//! What is *kept* is the delay model. Acting the instant the bot answers is
//! the most obvious tell there is, so the same human-timing policy runs here
//! (`autoplay::delay`). Tenhou never states its per-turn allowance on the
//! wire, but it has one and enforces it by auto-discarding, so the lobby's
//! standard clock is fed in as the budget — see
//! `tenhou_state::TURN_BASE_MS`.
//!
//! # Guards
//!
//! Every action is gated on a decision window the bridge saw open for our seat
//! (`tenhou_state::DecisionWindow`), so a decision that resolved while we were
//! still "thinking" cannot be answered late into the next one. Buttons carry a
//! second, independent guard for free: if the client is no longer offering
//! one, the selector matches nothing and the click is reported as skipped
//! rather than landing somewhere else.
