//! With `block_telemetry` on, an Aliyun SLS web-tracking beacon must be
//! answered by the proxy itself and never reach the upstream — while
//! ordinary traffic on the same proxy still forwards untouched.
//!
//! The stub upstream returns a distinctive body (`UPSTREAM_BODY`). A
//! forwarded request carries that body back to the client; a blocked one
//! cannot, because it never reached the upstream. That difference is the
//! whole proof, so no request counter is needed.
