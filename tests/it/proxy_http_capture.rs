//! The MITM proxy must record the HTTP traffic it intercepts, and must

//! Akagi recorded WebSocket frames and discarded everything else, so the
//! game's own HTTP was invisible: route topology, version endpoints, and
//! the analytics beacons through which the client reports on itself. This
//! drives a real proxy and a real upstream over real sockets and asserts
//! what comes back out of `<session>/inspector.jsonl`.
